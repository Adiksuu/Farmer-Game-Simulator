### 🌾 Farmer Game
・It's a Farmer Game Simulator! 
The game was made using Python. The project is constantly being developed! 

### 💚 FREE VERSION
・Currently the full version of the game has been moved to the demo version because there was no point in making 2 different versions of the game!
To download it, just download the file game.exe above. 

### ❔ HOW TO USE
・To play this game, just download it (preferably its latest version)

・Then open the game.exe file on your computer!

### 📣 LATEST VERSION
・In versions v1.6 and v1.6.1, a system of energy and day/night has been introduced. 

・When night arrives, when the player has too little energy, the whole game dies and resets! 

・A new "Go home" tab has been added, which allows you to check the time, going to bed (sleeping through the night) and leaving the house (returning to the game menu)
